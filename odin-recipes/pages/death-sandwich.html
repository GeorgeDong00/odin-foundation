        <h3><em>A sandwich that kills if not eaten with proper clothing</em></h3>
        <h4>Background Origin: Regular Show</h5>
        <p>A sandwich created by an ancient dojo sect thousands of years ago, and was a closely guarded secret. Eventually, a sensai took the recipe and made it into a commercial product. 
            The sandwich will kill the consumer if not eaten correctly. One must wear cut-off jean shorts and a mullet in order to eat it safely.</p>
        <p>If eaten incorrectly, the consumer will suffer a deadly illness. Sufferers will undergo six symptoms over the course of six hours. Victim's face will start to turn green and they start choking and gagging;
            Their face will start to feel like it's on fire; Their intestines melt away and leak out of their body. The victim will then shriek in pain, but no one will hear them since they lose their voice.
            They will then regain their voice, only to cry out for mercy in ancient, forgotten dialects. It will obviously conclude with death.</p>
