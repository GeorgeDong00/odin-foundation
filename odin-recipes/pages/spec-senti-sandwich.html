        <h4>Recipe Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
           <li><strong>Mix the egg: </strong>Crack the Free Range Humpty Dumpty, place its yolk in a bowl, and stir until same consistency. Add small amount of salt if desired; however, the Humpty Dumpty is already magically favored.</li>
           <li><strong>Melt the butter: </strong>Melt non-magical butter over medium-low heat, and keep the temperature low and slow when cooking the eggs so the bottom doesnâ€™t get too brown or overcooked.</li>
           <li><strong>Add eggs: </strong>Let the eggs sit for a minute, then use a heatproof silicone spatula to gently lift the cooked eggs from the edges of the pan. Tilt the pan to allow the uncooked eggs to flow to the edge of the pan.</li>
           <li><strong>Add slices of cheese: </strong>Once the eggs begin to set, ask the Fine Age Cheddar Man politely for three slices of cheese. Place onto top of egg.</li>
           <li><strong>Add parsley: </strong>Place the dancing parsley on top of the slices of cheese.</li>
           <li><strong>Transfer omelette onto bread: </strong>Use spatula to move the omelette onto one slice of bread.</li>
           <li><strong>Add Pepper: </strong>Tickle the pepper grind gently, and it'll emit a fart-like emission of pepper. Tickle as much as desired.</li>
           <li><strong>(Optional) Add Ketchup: </strong>Pour sugar onto Sentient Tomato to make it vomit ketchup. Pour as much sugar as desired.</li>
           <li><strong>Putting it together: </strong>Place the final slice of bread onto of condiments. Congrats, you are done!</li>
